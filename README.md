Welcome to the E-Commerce API, a robust and scalable solution based on the Onion architecture. This project is implemented in C# and utilizes Entity Framework for data access, SQL Server as the database, and incorporates various design patterns such as Unit of Work and Specification for enhanced maintainability and flexibility.

Please be aware that this project is currently unfinished, and further contributions and improvements are welcome.

Features
Onion Architecture: The project adheres to the Onion architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns, making it easy to maintain and test.

C# Language: The implementation is in C#, a versatile and powerful programming language.

Entity Framework: Leveraging Entity Framework for data access simplifies database interactions and promotes code-first development.

SQL Server: The project uses SQL Server as the relational database management system, providing a robust and scalable data storage solution.

Design Patterns:

Unit of Work: The Unit of Work pattern helps manage the transactional boundaries and simplifies the data access layer.
Specification: Specification pattern is employed to encapsulate query logic, promoting a more modular and maintainable codebase.
Identity and JWT Integration: User access is secured through the integration of Identity and JWT (JSON Web Tokens), ensuring authentication and authorization are handled securely.

Redis Caching: Redis caching is implemented to optimize performance by reducing the need for repeated database queries, enhancing response times.

Scalability: The architecture is designed with scalability in mind, making it well-suited for handling increased load and growth.
